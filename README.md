## Technologies Used
* Backend: Django Rest Framework (Python)
* Database: PostgreSQL
* Hosting: Supabase (for the database)
* Authentication: JWT login system
* Payments: Stripe integration
* Caching: For performance optimization

## Key Features
* Backend Functionality (Django Rest Framework)
* JWT Login System: Secure authentication to ensure safe user access.
* Stripe Payment Integration: Seamlessly handles payments for purchases and auctions.
* Cache System: Caches frequent queries to enhance performance and reduce server load.
* Full CRUD Operations:Implemented in various modules such as:
  -Bids
  -KYC (Know Your Customer)
  -Products and Categories
  -Tags
* Search Platform: Search functionality based on tags to improve discoverability of products.

## Database Design and Hosting (PostgreSQL on Supabase)
Entity-Relation Model to SQL Script:
I designed the entire database starting from the ER Model and implemented it via SQL scripts.
Triggers for Bidding and Purchase Flow:
These triggers ensure smooth interaction between bids, purchases, and payments.
Hosted on Supabase:
The PostgreSQL database is hosted on Supabase, allowing for easy management and scaling.

## Current Status
The project is not yet fully complete, but it is currently hosted and accessible for initial testing.

## How to Access
Instructions for accessing the platform and testing the current functionality will be provided soon.
